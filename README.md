# Description

This module is an axios third-party module to log any axios request as a curl command in the console. It was originally posted as a suggestion on the axios repository, but since we believed it wasn't in the scope of axios to release such feature, we decided to make it as an independent module.

# How it works

The module makes use of axios' interceptors to log the request as a cURL command. It also stores it in the response's config object. Therefore, the command can be seen in the app's console, as well as in the `res.config.curlCommand` property of the response.

# Changing the logger

By default, axios-curlirize uses the `console.log/error()` functions. It is possible to change the logger by doing something similar to this:

```javascript
// when initiating your curlirize instance
curlirize(axios, (result, err) => {
  const { command } = result;
  if (err) {
    // use your logger here
  } else {
    // use your logger here
  }
});
```

# How to use it

axios-curlirize is super easy to use. First you'll have to install it.

```shell
npm i --save axios-curlirize@latest
```

Then all you have to do is import and instanciate curlirize in your app. Here's a sample:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import express from "express";
import curlirize from "axios-curlirize";

const app = express();

// initializing axios-curlirize with your axios instance
curlirize(axios);

// creating dummy route
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send({ hello: "world!" });
});

// starting server
app.listen(7500, () => {
  console.log("Dummy server started on port 7500");
  /*
             The output of this in the console will be :
             curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data {"dummy":"data"} http://localhost:7500/
        */
  axios
    .post("http://localhost:7500/", { dummy: "data" })
    .then(res => {
      console.log("success");
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
});
```

# Disable the logger

By default, all requests will be logged. But you can disable this behaviour unitarily by setting the `curlirize` option to false within the axios request.

```javascript
axios
  .post(
    "http://localhost:7500/",
    { dummy: "data" },
    {
      curlirize: false
    }
  )
  .then(res => {
    console.log("success");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```
